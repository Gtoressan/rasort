# Rastomatic

This repository is designed to implement various sorting algorithms in the Rust programming language for educational purposes.

## Array sorting algorithms

Below are the algorithms that have been implemented or will be implemented in this project. The list may change.

| Algorithm  | Best Time  | Average Time | Worst Time | Worst Space Complexity | Is Implemented |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Quicksort  | `n log(n)` | `n log(n)`   | `n^2     ` | `log(n)`               | Not yet        |
| Mergesort  | `n log(n)` | `n log(n)`   | `n log(n)` | `n     `               | Not yet        |
| Bubblesort | `n       ` | `n^2     `   | `n^2     ` | `1     `               | Not yet        |
